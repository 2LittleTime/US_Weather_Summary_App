US Weather Summary Application

Blake McCabe - 20131003

This archive contains all the source and testing code for the .NET MVC sample application I created, called the US Weather Summary App.  It is currently published at http://usweathersummary.azurewebsites.net .

This application is used to visualize all the weather stations for the current set of QCLCD (Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data) from NOAA through the beginning of the QCLCD data set in 2005.

It represents my current learning curve for SSIS, ASP .NET MVC, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, a little bit of JQuery and JChartFX.  The idea was to atttempt to bring together a full stack example of something useful in MS .NET MVC.


Thanks,
Blake
